# EasyPDF

This project utilizes various technologies to generate PDFs with text content generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model and images fetched from Unsplash API. The main functionality involves creating a PDF document based on user-provided topics, with both textual content and relevant images.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Pipenv**: Dependency management tool for Python projects.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrates GPT-3.5 for generating text content.
- **Unsplash API**: Used to fetch high-quality images based on provided topics.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Python Imaging Library used for image processing.
- **FPDF**: Python library for creating PDFs.
- **Requests**: HTTP library for making API requests.
- **JSON**: For handling JSON data.
- **io**: Provides core tools for working with streams.
- **Time**: Used for delaying image placement in PDFs.

## Project Overview

The main functionality of the project involves generating PDF documents based on user-specified topics. The process involves two primary components:

1. **Text Content Generation**: The `content_generator` function uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate descriptive text content based on a provided prompt. This content is generated in response to a prompt related to the topic provided by the user.

2. **Image Generation and PDF Creation**: The `pdf_generator` function orchestrates the process of generating text content, creating a table of contents, fetching relevant images from Unsplash based on the topics, and integrating both text and images into a PDF document.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have Python and Pipenv installed on your system. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pipenv install` to install project dependencies.

3. **Obtain API Keys**: Obtain API keys for OpenAI and Unsplash, and store them securely. Replace placeholders in the `keys.py` file with your actual API keys.


## File Structure

- **main.py**: Main script orchestrating the PDF generation process.
- **image_generator.py**: Module responsible for fetching images from Unsplash API.
- **keys.py**: Placeholder file for storing API keys (Ensure not to expose API keys in version control).
- **README.md**: This file documenting the project overview, usage instructions, and technologies used.


### Usage

Run the program using `python main.py`.
